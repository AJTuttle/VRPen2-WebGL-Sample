This is a very simple sample of some basic VRPen functionality. While this build does not explore all the various features included in VRPen, it works as a very simple illustration of the core function of the software, collaborative drawing.

# Troubleshooting

Note: phones not supported

This is a quick build that was thrown together without much testing, so there are bound to be problems. Here are some troubleshooting steps, please submit an issue if you are still not able to run it.

## I can't see other people's drawings
1 - make sure you joined the same room

2 - turn off adblock or anything that could block network traffic

3 - try another browser (safarri tends to work well on macs)

## I can't see any drawing surface, its just black
1 - try other browser

2 - Unfortunately this likely means that there is a hardware (most likely gpu) incompatibility
